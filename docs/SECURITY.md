# Security Guide

Security architecture, hardening checklist, and best practices.

## Security Posture Overview

PeerMesh Core implements defense-in-depth with multiple security layers:

1. **Network Isolation** - Three-tier network segmentation
2. **Secret Management** - File-based secrets, never environment variables
3. **Non-Root Containers** - Minimal privileges for all services
4. **Docker Socket Protection** - Proxy isolates Docker API access
5. **Automatic HTTPS** - TLS termination at reverse proxy
6. **Security Response Headers** - HSTS, CSP, Permissions-Policy via Traefik middleware

## OpenBao Fallback Policy

For environments without TPM/vTPM support, OpenBao unseal handling must follow a fail-closed fallback policy. This project-level strategy is documented in:

- `docs/security/OPENBAO-NO-TPM-FALLBACK-STRATEGY.md`

## Security Operations Runbooks

Operator-facing runbooks for common hardening and recovery tasks:

- `docs/security/HOST-HARDENING-RUNBOOK.md`
- `docs/security/CONSOLE-RECOVERY-RUNBOOK.md`
- `docs/BACKUP-RESTORE.md#offsite-requirements`

## Network Isolation

### Network Rules

| Source | Destination | Allowed |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Internet | proxy-external | Yes (80, 443) |
| Internet | app-internal | No |
| Internet | db-internal | No |
| proxy-external | app-internal | Yes |
| app-internal | db-internal | Yes |
| db-internal | Internet | No |

### Implementation

Networks are defined in docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
networks:
  proxy-external:
    name: proxy-external
  app-internal:
    name: app-internal
    internal: true
  db-internal:
    name: db-internal
    internal: true
```

The `internal: true` flag prevents containers from accessing the internet.

## Secret Management

### File-Based Secrets

All secrets are stored as files, never as environment variables:

```yaml
# Correct - File-based secret
environment:
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/postgres_password
secrets:
  - postgres_password

secrets:
  postgres_password:
    file: ./secrets/postgres_password

# Wrong - Exposed in environment
environment:
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
```

### Why File-Based Secrets?

1. **Not in process listings** - `ps aux` won't show passwords
2. **Not in Docker inspect** - `docker inspect` won't expose them
3. **Not in logs** - Environment variable dumps won't include secrets
4. **Controlled permissions** - File permissions restrict access

### Secret File Permissions

```bash
# Set restrictive permissions
chmod 700 secrets/
chmod 600 secrets/*

# Verify
ls -la secrets/
# -rw-------  1 user user  44 Dec 31 12:00 postgres_password
```

### Secret Generation

Generate cryptographically secure secrets:

```bash
# Run the generation script
./scripts/generate-secrets.sh

# Or generate manually
openssl rand -base64 32 > secrets/my_secret
chmod 600 secrets/my_secret
```

## Non-Root Containers

All services run as non-root users where supported:

| Service | User:Group | UID:GID |
|---------|------------|---------|
| PostgreSQL | postgres:postgres | 70:70 |
| MySQL | mysql:mysql | 999:999 |
| MongoDB | mongodb:mongodb | 999:999 |
| Redis | redis:redis | 999:999 |
| Traefik | traefik:traefik | 65532:65532 |

### Implementation

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    user: "70:70"

  traefik:
    user: "65532:65532"
    read_only: true
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
```

## Docker Socket Protection

Docker socket access is dangerous - it's equivalent to root access on the host. Traefik needs socket access for service discovery, so we use a proxy.

### Docker Socket Proxy

```yaml
services:
  docker-socket-proxy:
    image: tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy
    environment:
      CONTAINERS: 1      # Read container info
      SERVICES: 0        # No Swarm services
      NETWORKS: 0        # No network management
      VOLUMES: 0         # No volume management
      IMAGES: 0          # No image management
      EXEC: 0            # No exec into containers
      POST: 0            # No write operations
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    networks:
      - docker-socket

  traefik:
    environment:
      DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker-socket-proxy:2375
    networks:
      - docker-socket
      - proxy-external
```

### Why Socket Proxy?

- Traefik can discover containers (CONTAINERS=1)
- Traefik cannot create/delete containers (POST=0)
- Traefik cannot exec into containers (EXEC=0)
- Socket only accessible on internal network

## TLS Configuration

### Automatic HTTPS

Traefik handles TLS termination with Let's Encrypt:

```yaml
services:
  traefik:
    command:
      - "--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.email=${ADMIN_EMAIL}"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.tlschallenge=true"
```

### TLS Best Practices

Default configuration enforces:

- TLS 1.2 minimum (TLS 1.3 preferred)
- Strong cipher suites only
- HSTS headers
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect

### Self-Signed Certificates (Development)

For local development without valid domain:

```env
TRAEFIK_ACME_STAGING=true
```

## Security Response Headers

All HTTPS traffic receives security headers automatically via Traefik middleware defined in `configs/traefik/dynamic/security.yml`. Production Authentik forward-auth chains are tracked separately in `configs/traefik/dynamic/authentik.yml`.

### Default Headers (applied to all websecure traffic)

The `security-headers@file` middleware is set as the entrypoint-level default on `websecure`, so every router inherits it without explicit labels.

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Strict-Transport-Security | max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload | Force HTTPS for 1 year |
| Content-Security-Policy | default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; ... | Restrict resource loading |
| X-Frame-Options | DENY | Prevent clickjacking |
| X-Content-Type-Options | nosniff | Prevent MIME sniffing |
| Permissions-Policy | camera=(), microphone=(), ... | Disable browser features |
| Referrer-Policy | strict-origin-when-cross-origin | Limit referrer leakage |
| X-Powered-By | (stripped) | Hide technology stack |
| Server | (stripped) | Hide server identity |

### API Headers Override

API-only routes (JSON endpoints) can use `api-security-headers@file` instead, which sets a stricter CSP (`default-src 'none'`) appropriate for non-HTML responses. Apply via Traefik label:

```yaml
labels:
  - "traefik.http.routers.myapi.middlewares=api-security-headers@file"
```

### Per-Service Overrides

Services that need a custom CSP (e.g., embedding iframes, loading external scripts) can define their own headers middleware via Docker labels. The per-router middleware list replaces the entrypoint default, so the service takes full control of its headers.

## Events Gateway Rate-Limit Candidate

Core tracks inert per-IP and trusted-actor middleware candidates for the Events
route classes in `configs/traefik/dynamic/events-rate-limits.yml`. The contract,
attachment order, route mapping, and production proof gates are documented in
`docs/contracts/EVENTS-GATEWAY-RATE-LIMIT-CONTRACT-v0.1.md`.

These definitions do not make Events production-ready by themselves. The
standalone `docker-compose.events-sandbox.yml` attaches them after
`peermesh-auth@file` for executable local proof only. Production still must
attach an Events runtime and prove real-client IP attribution, trusted
Authentik actor headers, route coverage, 429 behavior, cleanup-route isolation,
and counter behavior for the deployed edge topology.

## Dashboard API Authentication

### Authentication-First Design

The Core Dashboard protects **all endpoints** behind authentication, including typically-public endpoints like `/api/health`. This is an intentional secure-by-default design decision.

**Rationale:**

- **No information disclosure**: Even health status can reveal system information to attackers
- **Consistent security model**: No exceptions to authentication policy in default configuration
- **Defense-in-depth**: Additional layer beyond network-level access controls

**Trade-offs:**

- External monitoring tools (Uptime Kuma, Prometheus exporters, etc.) cannot check `/api/health` without credentials
- Users must explicitly opt-in to public health endpoints if needed

**Customizing for Monitoring:**

If your deployment requires a public health endpoint for external monitoring:

1. Edit the auth middleware in `services/dashboard/handlers/auth.go`
2. Add an exception for `/api/health`:
   ```go
   // Example: exempt health endpoint from authentication
   if r.URL.Path == "/api/health" {
       next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
       return
   }
   ```
3. Document your modification in deployment notes
4. Consider network-level access controls (IP allowlisting) as an alternative

**Security vs. Convenience:**

This design favors security over convenience. The health endpoint authentication is not a bug - it's a deliberate architectural choice. Users who need different behavior must explicitly modify the code, ensuring conscious security decisions.

## CI/CD Security Controls

Deployment security model:

1. Production deployment is pull-based webhook execution from the VPS.
2. Push-based GitHub Actions deployment (`deploy.yml`) remains disabled by default.
3. Deploy workflow edits are guarded by pre-commit and require explicit override:

```bash
ALLOW_DEPLOY_WORKFLOW_EDIT=true git commit -m "..."
```

Guarded files:

1. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml.DISABLED`

```bash
# Using Docker Scout (Docker Desktop)
docker scout cves traefik:v2.11

# Using Trivy
trivy image traefik:v2.11
```

## Incident Response

### Suspected Compromise

1. **Isolate** - Stop affected containers
   ```bash
   docker compose stop
   ```

2. **Preserve** - Keep logs and data for analysis
   ```bash
   docker compose logs > incident-logs.txt
   ```

3. **Rotate** - Generate new secrets
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate-secrets.sh --force
   ```

4. **Rebuild** - Pull fresh images
   ```bash
   docker compose pull --ignore-buildable
   docker compose up -d --force-recreate
   ```

### Log Locations

| Service | Log Access |
|---------|------------|
| All services | `docker compose logs <service>` |
| Traefik access | Traefik container: `/var/log/traefik/` |
| Authelia | `docker compose logs authelia` |

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. Do not open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to the maintainers
3. Allow time for a fix before public disclosure
